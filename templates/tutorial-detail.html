<h2>Introduction to Generative AI</h2>
<p>
Generative AI is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many industries. This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of generative AI, including what it is, how it works, and what it can be used for.
</p>
<h3>What is Generative AI?</h3>
<p>
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, and music. This is in contrast to traditional AI, which can only perform tasks that it has been explicitly programmed to do.
</p>
<h3>How does Generative AI work?</h3>
<p>
Generative AI uses a variety of techniques to create new content. One common technique is to use a neural network, which is a type of artificial intelligence that is inspired by the human brain. Neural networks can be trained on large datasets of existing content, and then they can use this training to generate new content that is similar to the content in the dataset.
</p>
<h3>What can Generative AI be used for?</h3>
<p>
Generative AI can be used for a variety of applications, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating new text, such as articles, blog posts, and stories</li>
<li>Generating new images, such as photos, illustrations, and paintings</li>
<li>Composing new music, such as songs, symphonies, and operas</li>
<li>Developing new drugs and treatments</li>
<li>Designing new products and materials</li>
</ul>
